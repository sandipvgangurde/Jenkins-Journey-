*For Pipeline Setup, Configuration, and Control*

---

## 1. Overview

This menu appears at the **pipeline project level** in Jenkins, allowing configuration and control over the entire pipeline project, not individual builds.

It's essential for **pipeline setup**, **maintenance**, **manual triggering**, and **security management**.

---

## 2. Detailed Description of Menu Options

### 2.1 Status 📋

* **What:** Displays overall pipeline status, including last build results.
* **Use:**

  * Quick health check for the pipeline at a glance.
* **Example:** See if the last build succeeded or failed.

### 2.2 Changes 🔍

* **What:** Shows the entire change history affecting the pipeline.
* **Use:**

  * Track development activity over time.
* **Example:** View which commits triggered which builds.

### 2.3 Build Now ▶️

* **What:** Immediately triggers a new build manually.
* **Use:**

  * Run a pipeline build on-demand without waiting for triggers.
* **Example:** After fixing an environment issue, trigger a new build.

### 2.4 Configure ⚙️

* **What:** Opens the pipeline configuration interface.
* **Use:**

  * Modify Jenkinsfile, environment variables, build triggers, and other pipeline settings.
* **Example:** Add a new stage to the pipeline or update SCM repository URL.

### 2.5 Delete Pipeline 🗑️

* **What:** Removes the entire pipeline and all build history.
* **Use:**

  * Remove obsolete or broken pipelines.
* **Warning:** This action is irreversible.

### 2.6 Stages 🏗️

* **What:** Visualizes all stages in the pipeline with their status.
* **Use:**

  * Get an overview of pipeline flow and bottlenecks.
* **Example:** Identify long-running or flaky stages.

### 2.7 Rename ✏️

* **What:** Rename the pipeline project.
* **Use:**

  * Improve clarity or update naming conventions.

### 2.8 Pipeline Syntax 🧑‍💻

* **What:** Helps generate scripted or declarative pipeline code snippets.
* **Use:**

  * Assist developers in writing Jenkinsfiles or pipeline scripts correctly.
* **Example:** Generate syntax for input steps, environment variables, or credentials.

### 2.9 Credentials 🔐

* **What:** Manage sensitive information such as passwords, SSH keys, tokens used in the pipeline.
* **Use:**

  * Securely inject credentials during builds.
* **Example:** Add Git SSH keys or Docker Hub passwords.

---

## 3. Practical Use Case Scenario

You want to add a new testing stage to your pipeline:

* Go to **Configure** to edit Jenkinsfile or pipeline script.
* Use **Pipeline Syntax** to generate the correct code snippet for your test stage.
* After editing, click **Build Now** to trigger a new pipeline run.
* Use **Stages** to monitor the new test stage's execution.
* Store any necessary API keys via **Credentials** to be used in this stage.

## 5. Tips & Best Practices

* Use **Build Now** for quick manual builds.
* Always backup or version control Jenkinsfile before modifying via **Configure**.
* Manage secrets securely via **Credentials**; never hard-code sensitive info.
* Use **Pipeline Syntax** to avoid scripting errors.
* Clean up old pipelines carefully to avoid accidental data loss.
