## 1. Overview

When you click on a specific Jenkins build (like `#36`), you’ll see a menu to:

* Inspect the build 🔍
* Debug problems 🛠️
* Check logs 🖥️
* Manage build lifecycle 📦

It’s especially useful for **troubleshooting failed builds** or **tracking changes**.

| **Restart from Stage**    | 🔄      | Re-run build from a specific stage       | Save time by skipping successful stages     | Retry only integration tests                |
| **Replay**                | ▶️      | Re-run build with same code & parameters | Reproduce intermittent issues               | Debug environment problems                  |
| **Pipeline Steps**        | 🧱      | Step-by-step execution details           | Inspect granular steps for debugging        | Find slow or failing steps                  |

## 3. Practical Example 🛠️

**Scenario:** You got an email that Build #36 failed.

**Steps to troubleshoot:**

1. Open **Console Output 🖥️** → check logs for errors.
2. Open **Changes 🔍** → see what commits were included.
3. Open **Pipeline Overview 🌐** → identify which stage failed.
4. Use **Replay ▶️** → reproduce the issue.
5. If fixed in a later commit, compare with **Previous Build ⬅️**.
6. Use **Restart from Stage 🔄** → retry only failing tests.

## 4. Visual Tree of Build Menu 🌳

```plaintext
Build #36 Menu
├── 🔍 Changes
├── 🖥️ Console Output
├── ✏️ Edit Build Info
├── 🗑️ Delete Build
├── ⏱️ Timings
├── 🌐 Pipeline Overview
├── 🔄 Restart from Stage
├── ▶️ Replay

## 5. Quick Tips ✅

* Check **Console Output 🖥️** first if a build fails.
* Use **Timings ⏱️** regularly to speed up pipelines.
* Document special notes with **Edit Build Info ✏️**.
* Clean old builds with **Delete Build 🗑️** to save space.
