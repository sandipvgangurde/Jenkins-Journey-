## 🧩 **1. What Is a Jenkins Pipeline?**

A **Pipeline** in Jenkins is a series of automated steps — written in code — that define how your software is **built**, **tested**, and **deployed**.

You write it in a file called **`Jenkinsfile`** using the **Groovy-based Declarative Pipeline syntax**.

## ⚙️ **2. Create Your First Jenkins Pipeline**

### 🪜 Step-by-Step

#### 🧱 Step 1: Open Jenkins Dashboard

➡️ Go to your Jenkins dashboard:
👉 [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

---

#### 🧱 Step 2: Create a New Pipeline

1. Click **“New Item”** on the left sidebar.
2. Enter a name, e.g., `hello-jenkins-pipeline` 🧑‍💻
3. Select **“Pipeline”** and click **OK**.

---

#### 🧱 Step 3: Add the Pipeline Script

1. Scroll down to the **Pipeline** section.
2. Under **Definition**, choose **“Pipeline script”** (not “from SCM” for now).
3. In the **Script** box, paste the following code 👇

---

## 👋 **3. Jenkins Pipeline Code Example**

Here’s a simple **“Hello Jenkins” pipeline** that prints messages at different stages:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo '🏗️ Building the application...'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo '🧪 Running tests...'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo '🚀 Deploying the application...'
            }
        }

        stage('Finish') {
            steps {
                echo '✅ Pipeline completed successfully!'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 💡 **Explanation of Each Section:**

| 🧩 Section             | 📘 Description                                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pipeline`             | Defines the start of your Jenkins pipeline                |
| `agent any`            | Tells Jenkins to run the job on any available agent       |
| `stage('Build')`       | Logical step – usually where code is compiled or packaged |
| `steps { echo '...' }` | Commands executed inside the stage                        |
| `echo`                 | Prints text to the Jenkins console output                 |

---

#### 🧱 Step 4: Save and Run the Pipeline

1. Click **“Save”** ✅
2. On the left side, click **“Build Now”** ▶️

---

## 🧭 **4. Check Real-Time Output**

Once the pipeline starts:

1. Click the small **#1** (build number) under “Build History.”
2. Then click **“Console Output.”**

You’ll see something like this 👇

```
Started by user admin
Running in Jenkins agent
[Pipeline] Start of Pipeline
[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Build)
🏗️ Building the application...
[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Test)
🧪 Running tests...
[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Deploy)
🚀 Deploying the application...
[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Finish)
✅ Pipeline completed successfully!
[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] End of Pipeline
Finished: SUCCESS
```

🎉 **Congratulations!** You’ve just run your first Jenkins pipeline successfully!

---

## 🧠 **5. (Optional) Save Your Jenkinsfile in Git**

In real-world projects, the pipeline code is stored in your repository as a file named `Jenkinsfile`.

Example file structure:

```
my-project/
├── src/
│   ├── app.py
│   └── requirements.txt
└── Jenkinsfile
```

You can then tell Jenkins to pull this file from your Git repository by selecting:

> **Pipeline → Definition → Pipeline script from SCM → Git**

---

## 🌳 **6. Visual Pipeline Flow**

```
🌳 Jenkins Pipeline
│
├── 🏗️ Build Stage
│    └── echo "Building the application..."
│
├── 🧪 Test Stage
│    └── echo "Running tests..."
│
├── 🚀 Deploy Stage
│    └── echo "Deploying the application..."
│
└── ✅ Finish Stage
     └── echo "Pipeline completed successfully!"
```

## 🏁 **7. Summary**

| ✅ Step | 🧭 Description                    |
| ------ | --------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣    | Created a new Pipeline project    |
| 2️⃣    | Added Jenkinsfile code            |
| 3️⃣    | Ran the pipeline                  |
| 4️⃣    | Viewed real-time console output   |
